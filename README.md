# Project Report: Association Management Application

## Context
In today's digital era, technological advancements have transformed work processes across all sectors, including the associative sector. The significant evolution in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has made online presence crucial for associations to develop relationships with members. This digital shift facilitates the board members' work, enhances funding opportunities, recruits and trains new members, and ensures the smooth running of association activities.

## Objective
The primary goal is to design and implement an association management application. This application will provide a platform for office members to manage members, roles, events, and news. It will also enable members to view event lists, access news, and participate in events.

## Functionalities

- **Office Member**: A person responsible for managing the association (event management, member management, etc.) and making decisions.
- **Member**: A registered user who receives notifications and participates in the association's activities.
- **Sponsor**: A person who donates and receives publicity for their company in return.

### Functional Requirements

#### Visitor
- **Account Creation**: Visitors can create an account to become members.

#### Sponsor
- **Advertising Requests**: Sponsors can request advertising for their products.

#### Office Member
- **Member Management**: Manage member information and roles.
- **Role Management**: Assign and manage roles within the association.
- **Advertising Management**: Manage advertising requests from sponsors.

#### Member and Office Member
- **Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality.
- **Profile Management**: Update and manage personal profiles.
- **News Feed**: View the latest news and updates.
- **Event List**: Access and register for upcoming events.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability and User-Friendliness
- **Intuitive Interface**: Provide a user-friendly and simple interface suitable for all users, including non-technical users.

### Security
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Restrict access based on user privileges.
- **Data Protection**: Secure sensitive information through encryption and other security measures.

### Reliability
- **Accurate Results**: Ensure the system delivers precise and fair results.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to maintain system stability.

### Scalability
- **Modular Architecture**: Facilitate the easy addition, removal, or update of different modules.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure efficient handling of increasing users and data.

### Maintainability and Reusability
- **Clean Code Practices**: Adhere to clean coding standards for easy modification and understanding.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation to aid in future development and maintenance.

## Design Approach
To design an association management application effectively, we follow these steps:

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Stakeholder Meetings**: Discuss with association members, office members, and potential users to understand their needs.
- **Use Cases**: Outline specific functionalities for each user type.
- **User Stories**: Develop detailed user stories describing interactions with the application.

### 2. Wireframing and Prototyping
- **Wireframing Tools**: Use tools like Balsamiq, Sketch, or Figma.
- **Prototyping Tools**: Use tools like InVision or Adobe XD to develop interactive prototypes.

### 3. Detailed Design
- **High-Level Architecture**: Outline the major components, their interactions, and data flow.
- **Database Design**: Design the database schema.
- **API Design**: Define RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.
- **UI/UX Design**: Develop detailed designs for each screen.

### 4. Technology Stack Selection
- **Frontend**: React.js for dynamic user interfaces.
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core for scalable server-side logic.
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server for data storage.
- **Authentication**: IdentityServer for secure access control.
- **Hosting**: Azure for cloud hosting.
- **DevOps**: GitHub for version control, CI/CD pipelines, Docker for containerization.

### 5. Implementation Plan
- **Milestones**: Break down the project into milestones with specific deliverables.
- **Timeline**: Create a project timeline with deadlines.
- **Team Roles**: Assign roles and responsibilities to team members.

## Resources and Tools

### Project Management
- **Jira**
- **Trello**
- **Asana**

### Collaboration
- **Slack**
- **Microsoft Teams**

### Version Control
- **GitHub** for code repository and version control.

### Example Resources
- **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or LinkedIn Learning for tutorials on React.js, ASP.NET Core, etc.
- **Documentation**: Official documentation of React.js, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft SQL Server, and IdentityServer.
- **Community Forums**: Stack Overflow, GitHub Communities, and other developer forums for support and guidance.

## Conclusion
The association management application will provide a comprehensive platform for managing members, events, communication, and sponsorships. By prioritizing usability, security, and scalability, this application will empower office members to streamline operations and foster greater member engagement, ensuring the associationâ€™s long-term success.
